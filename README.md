# MantisAI Slides Repository

A centralized repository for presentation slides from MantisAI team talks and presentations.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as a public archive of presentation slides from MantisAI team members. After giving talks at conferences, meetups, workshops, or other events, we upload the slides here so attendees and the broader community can access them.

## 📁 Directory Structure

We organize slides using a date-event naming convention:

```
YYYY/
└── YYYY-MM-event-name/
    ├── slides.pdf
    ├── README.md (optional)
    └── resources/ (optional)
```

### Examples:

```
2024/
├── 2024-01-pydata-london/
│   ├── slides.pdf
│   └── README.md
├── 2024-03-ai-summit-berlin/
│   ├── slides.pdf
│   └── resources/
│       └── demo-notebook.ipynb
└── 2024-06-govtech-conference/
    └── slides.pdf

2025/
└── 2025-02-data-science-expo/
    ├── slides.pdf
    └── README.md
```

## 📋 Naming Convention

- **Year folders**: `YYYY/` (e.g., `2024/`, `2025/`)
- **Event folders**: `YYYY-MM-event-name/` (e.g., `2024-03-pydata-london/`)
- **Main slides**: Always named `slides.pdf`
- **Optional files**: 
  - `README.md` for event details, abstract, or additional context
  - `resources/` folder for supplementary materials (notebooks, code, datasets)

## 🚀 How to Contribute
